**Third** go at my recipe.

Second time was better than the first, but still not enough salt and maybe not enough active yeast? Might also need 1/2 cup more water?

##Ingredients
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp active yeast
- 3 cups flour
- 1 cup natural yeast [sourdough starter](sourdough-starter.md)

##Method
- Combine the **water**, **1/2 cup of the flour**, and the **sourdough starter** in a bowl
- Let sit ~15 minutes
- Mix in the remaining **flour**
- Knead ~15 minutes
- Let sit ~2 hours

- Divide into two balls and place each in a floured and plastic covered bowl
- Let sit ~1.5 hours
- Bake at 400ºF for 35 minutes if on a pan
- Bake at 400ºF for 55 minutes if in a dutch oven
