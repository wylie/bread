This is a recipe for a natural yeast sourdough starter.

##Ingredients
- 2 cup water to start
- 2 cups all-purpose flour to start

##Method
####Day 1
- Combine the **water** and **flour**
- Cover with cheesecloth or dishtowel, something that will allow yeast to get into the mix, but not bugs or debris
- Let sit for a day

####Day 2
- Stir up the starter
- Add to the starter **1/4 cup water** and **1/4 cup flour**
- Mix together and let sit for a day

Repeat this for several days. If you don't end up seeing the starter slowly bubble up after feeding it, and it doesn't start to smell 'sour', then you may want to start over.
